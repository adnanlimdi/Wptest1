Some notes...
1. Again, no UI, nothing fancy. Basic CRUD API – with basic validations and security checks.
2. You can build on top of WordPress REST API or with simple GET/POST actions on a URL.
3. An “Event” will have a title, start date-time, end date-time, description and category.
4. Only an admin user should use the API.
5. Possible API endpoints: ‘/events/create’, ‘/events/update’, ‘/events/list?
date=DATE’, ‘/events/delete’, ‘/events/show?id=ID’. But feel free to change these as
you see fit.
6. When you submit your work, make sure the code is clean and tested. Along with code, also
submit a note describing your implementation approach and what future additions would
you make to the API.

Task C01: Life incident
Describe one of your most memorable experience with one of your friends in 200-250 words.
What was the situation? What was special about them? What made it memorable?

=> When I was study in class 9th , That time Me and My friends going for tour in Udaipur , Here is most memorable time is we was visit places 
Lake Pichola and City Palace of Udaipur is was such nice/rember place. We have seen many forigner and meet with him and know about his culture it was memorable and new thing.

The most memorable day of my life took place in high school.  the school arranged a trip to an orphanage on the outskirts of Ahmdabad. The day is pretty close to my heart.
We reached the orphanage at around 8 in the morning. All the children came running towards us as they got to meet new people and make new friends. We all ate breakfast together. 
We served them bread, juice, biscuits, milk, etc., and their faces lightened up as they did not get these on a regular basis. After breakfast, we played games and had lots of fun.
I made a lot of friends among those children. I realised how happy they got in the smallest things we did for them. 

Their expressions made me realise that life is all about the small happiness that we miss to cherish in our daily life. After the games, we distributed them chocolates and it was time to return.
The farewell was heartbreaking but with that farewell, 
I was returning back with self-realisation and learnt the true meaning of happiness from those children who chose to smile amidst sorrows and pain.


Task C02: The coolest technology?
In your opinion (and imagination), what would be the coolest computer / computing device /

Please describe your imagination in at least 100 words.

Answer: 
A personal computer is designed to be a general-purpose device. 
That is, it can be used to solve many different types of problems. As the technologies of the personal computer have become more commonplace,
 many of the components have been integrated into other devices that previously were purely mechanical.
